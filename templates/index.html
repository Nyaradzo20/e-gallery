            <p>E-gallery is a web application where by people, organizations and countries 
                write their own history for the future generation to come. 
                History in our generation is all in books and in the words of 
                who might have seen what take place at the time. So our app is here to improve 
                how the future generation is going to learn about their family, 
                country and organizations history. We intend to accomplish this by giving people, families, 
                organizations and countries a platform to record events as they unfold. 
                These allows anyone who wants to learn about an organization, or country to just visit and 
                learn anything he/she might be looking for.</p>
